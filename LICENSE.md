SUPER IMPORTANT LEGAL DOCUMENT
------------------------------
#1 GENERAL
I don't give two hoots what you do with any of the design or code you find here.

#2 COMMERCIAL
Actually, I do. I hope you take it and use it, uncredited, on a super commercial website and get wicked rich off it. I hope you use it at work and your boss is impressed and you get a big promotion. I hope it helps you design a website and that website impresses somebody you think is super hot and you get married and have smart, chill babies. I hope you use the code in a blog post you write elsewhere and that website gets way more popular and awesome than this one.

#3 CREDITS
If you feel like telling me about it, cool. If not, no big deal. If you feel better crediting it, that's cool. If not, don't sweat it.

#4 CONTENT
If you copy an entire content from this site and republish it on your own site like you wrote it, that's a little uncool. I won't be mad at you for stealing, I just think you're better than that and want to see you do better. I'm not going to come after you though. I'd rather play ball with my dog. The only time I'll be mad at you is if you go out of your way to try and hurt me somehow. And again I probably won't even be mad, just sad. Unless I'm having a bad day too, in which case I apologize in advance for my snarky replies.

#5 WARRANTY
I ve done my best to respect the best practices, and checked every single bits, but i warranty you there is no warranty of any kind neither with the code nor the content you find here. you take it as is and use at your own risks. I will not be responsible if a meteorite wreck your house after you put anything from here to your own site or an other. In the same time i will not be responsible if your own web site crunch or if any part of your IT felt down after using this. Finally i will not be responsible even if you cause a nuclear explosion risk with anything you take from here, in which case the only thing i would ask you, is not to tell me, i prefer to die not worried about that. but if you do so i won't be mad.

#6 GOAL
I want the web to get better and being all Johnny Protective over everything doesn't get us there. I understand other people feel differently about this and might have semi-legit reasons for protecting certain code, design, writing, or whatever. I work on some closed-source projects myself. This isn't one of them. Go nuts.
